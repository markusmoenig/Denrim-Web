We’re excited to ship Denrim: Noise v1.0 — a fast, GPU-accelerated procedural noise tool for artists, designers, and developers.

## What’s in v1.0

- **7 noise types**: OpenSimplex 2/2S, Perlin, Value, Cellular (Voronoi), Sinusoidal, and Gabor.
- **Advanced fractals**: FBM, Ridged, and Ping Pong with up to 8 octaves.
- **Domain warping**: Dual-layer warp for organic, flowing patterns.
- **Gradient coloring**: 4-stop gradients to turn grayscale noise into vivid textures.
- **Seamless tiling**: Perfect loops for games, 3D textures, and motion graphics.
- **3D lighting**: Bump/normal-style rendering with controllable light, metalness, and roughness.
- **High-res export**: 512–8192px, multiple aspect ratios and formats.
- **Cross-platform**: Native apps for macOS and iPad with iCloud sync, plus builds for Windows and Linux.

## Why it matters

Denrim: Noise focuses on creative speed — tweak, warp, color, and export in seconds, with GPU rendering to keep your viewport and exports responsive even at high resolutions.
