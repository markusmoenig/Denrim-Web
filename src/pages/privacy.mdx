# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: May 1, 2024_

Denrim is built to keep your creative work local to your devices. This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

## What we collect

- **App data**: Projects and exports stay on your device or your own iCloud storage. We do not receive or inspect your content.
- **Crash reports (optional)**: If you opt in to share diagnostics through the OS, Apple may send anonymized crash data to help us improve stability.
- **Support messages**: When you contact us, we receive the info you provide (like email and message content) to respond.

## How we use data

- Maintain and improve app performance and stability.
- Respond to support requests.
- Monitor basic, aggregated metrics (e.g., installs) provided by the App Store.

## Storage and retention

- Your creative files remain on your device or your iCloud account.
- Crash diagnostics, if provided, are retained by Apple and made available to us in aggregate.
- Support emails are kept as long as needed to handle your request.

## Sharing

We do not sell or rent your data. We may share limited data with:

- **Platform providers** (Apple) for distribution, payments, and diagnostics.
- **Service providers** we use for support or hosting, bound by confidentiality and data protection terms.

## Children

Denrim is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Your choices

- Disable diagnostic sharing in your OS settings if you do not want to send crash data.
- Contact us to request deletion of support correspondence.

## Changes

We may update this policy. If we make material changes, we will update the date above and highlight updates in the app or on the site.
